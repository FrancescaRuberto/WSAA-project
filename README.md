# Anime Database Manager - Web Application

**Live Application**: [Anime Manager](http://fraruberto.pythonanywhere.com)  

## Overview
The goal of this project was to develop a full-stack web application that allows users to interact with a database containing various anime titles, each with a set of detailed attributes such as title, genre, release year, and rating.

The base project architecture includes:
- A **Flask server** that provides a RESTful API for performing all database operations (CRUD)
- A **web interface** that enables users to interact with the API through a simple and intuitive UI

To make the application more accessible and easy to demonstrate, the complete web app has been **hosted on PythonAnywhere**.

- **View** all anime entries in the database with full details presented in a clear, responsive interface  
- **Search** for a specific anime by ID to display its complete information  
- **Add** a new anime entry using an intuitive submission form  
- **Edit** an existing anime by searching for it via ID and updating its details  
- **Delete** anime entries from the database when no longer needed
